Timeframe accesses private read-only user Google Calendar data via the Google API.

It uses this data to display calendar events in a feed for use in your home.

Your data is stored locally on the device Timeframe runs on and is not shared or transferred elsewhere in any way.

Timeframe's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.
